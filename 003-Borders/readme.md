# 003-Borders
***

## Goal: Add borders to HTML elements.

*Instructions:*

Try to replicate the example image provided on the webpage by adding styling in your
`app.css` file using the `border` property.

*Hint:* You can adjust multiple property values of the `border` property all on one line.

For example, `border: 30px dashed yellow` will produce a dashed, yellow border with a width of 30px.

The order of these values doesn't matter, but standard practice is to write `border: <width> <style> <color>`, in that order.
